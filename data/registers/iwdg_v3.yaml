    description: 'Watchdog counter window value These bits are write access protected (see ). They are written by software to define at which position of the IWDCNT down-counter the early wakeup interrupt must be generated. The early interrupt is generated when the IWDCNT is lower or equal to EWIT[11:0] - 1. EWIT[11:0] must be bigger than 1. An interrupt is generated only if EWIE = 1. The EWU bit in the must be reset to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the Early wakeup comparator value and the Interrupt enable bit from the VDD voltage domain. This value may not be up to date/valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing, hence the value read from this register is valid only when the EWU bit in the is reset.'

Writing the key value 0x5555 to enable access to the IWDG_PR, IWDG_RLR and IWDG_WINR registers (see ) Writing the key value 0xCCCC starts the watchdog (except if the hardware watchdog option is selected).
