A new computation starts as soon as a new valid sequence is initiated, and KEYCRC is read as zero until a valid sequence is completed. When KEYLOCK = 1, KEYCRC remains unchanged until the next reset. CRC computation is an 8-bit checksum using the standard CRC-8-CCITT algorithm X8 + X2 + X + 1 (according the convention). Source code is available in . This field is read only.
