      description: "[31: 0]: Data Data to be sent/received to/from the external SPI device In Indirect-write mode, data written to this register is stored on the FIFO before it is sent to the external device during the data phase. If the FIFO is too full, a write operation is stalled until the FIFO has enough space to accept the amount of data being written. In Indirect-read mode, reading this register gives (via the FIFO) the data that was received from the external device. If the FIFO does not have as many bytes as requested by the read operation and if BUSY = 1, the read operation is stalled until enough data is present or until the transfer is complete, whichever happens first. In Automatic status-polling mode, this register contains the last data read from the external device (without masking). Word, half-word, and byte accesses to this register are supported. In Indirect-write mode, a byte write adds 1 byte to the FIFO, a half-word write 2 bytes, and a word write 4 bytes. Similarly, in Indirect-read mode, a byte read removes 1 byte from the FIFO, a halfword read 2 bytes, and a word read 4 bytes. Accesses in Indirect mode must be aligned to the bottom of this register: A byte read must read DATA[7:0] and a half-word read must read DATA[15:0]."
